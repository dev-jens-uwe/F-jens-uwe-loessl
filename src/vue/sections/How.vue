            <h2>Turn you ideas into reality</h2>
            <p>I am a full stack developer, who loves to turn your ideas into reality. Getting a reward by good user
                ratings und usability is my focus.</p>
            <p>To reach this goal, I prefer to work with the following technology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frontend: TypeScript, VueJs, React, npm, Sass, Less</li>
                <li>Backend: php, Laravel, Java, EclipseLink, nodejs (Express), MySql, MS SQL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For getting the most out of my work, working with continuous integration is a requirement for me. Writing
                unit and integration test will result in a better maintainability.</p>
            <p>I strongly believe that one developer can build a good piece of software. But great software is the
                result of strong team. To integrate in and build up that team is one of my main strength.</p>
