        <h2>Boost your sales with a powerful web application</h2>
        <p>With a modern and well optimized website you will increase your reach by raising the user experience. That
            will make you visitors happier and stay longer on you site.</p>
        <h2>Reduce your costs with optimized speed</h2>
        <p>Faster websites will rank better in search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. But moving calculation from
            the server to the client, will lower the costs you will spend on infrastructure, when your application is
            getting popular.</p>
        <h2>React flexible to changes on the market environment</h2>
        <p>By modularizing and encapsulating individual software parts, they can be easily replaced. Separating the user
            interface from the business logic will bring you in the position to change technologies or small parts based
            on market development.</p>
