<H2>The data-driven world we live in...</H2>
<P>'Data is money', I am sure you already heard about this term. It's true, data is the most valuable asset in the world today. Companies
  like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many others were building their business model around data.</P>
<P>And data is what we need to handle in our applications: We have to display something to our users, we have to process data and
  we have to push data to a backend server, or other systems.</P>

<H2>The CRUD-ish way</H2>
<P>A lot of web application are built 'CRUD' -alike: You load a resource from the backend, the user is updating some properties, and you
  send the updated resource back to the backend. Thinking this way, results in an UI that is made for those operations. The result is an
  application that provides a lot of list views, create, update, and delete possibilities on resources. Assuming you are building a blog,
  in the 'crud-ish' way you think about creating a post, updating it and deleting it.</P>

<P>The problem is: We as human do not think about 'updating' some data. We are using you web apps <Italic>for accomplish a task -
  quickly.</Italic> So wouldn't it be natural, that we model our application around those tasks? Displaying a list of unreleased posts with
  a release button. This could be a solution for quickly releasing posts from draft.</P>

<H2>Modeling around events</H2>
<H3>Let's start with just commands</H3>

<P>To make it easier to follow, we should reduce complexity and do a little trick: Let's do not think about what we show and only think
  about the interactions of a user. Lets call them `commands`. Everything that has to do with UI is only allowed to emit/dispatch these
  commands. An example for emitting an event to a global <ExternalLink href={"https://rxjs.dev/guide/subject"}>subject from
    rxjs.</ExternalLink></P>

```tsx
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const GlobalEvent$ = new Subject();

class ReleasePostEvent {
  public readonly type = 'POST_RELEASE_COMMAND';
  public readonly payload = new ReleasePostPayload();
}

class ReleasePostPayload {
  public postId: string;
}

const UiComponent = ({ postId }) => {

  const handleReleasePost = (postId: string) => {
      const event = new ReleasePostEvent();
      event.payload.postId = postId;

      GlobalEvent$.next(event);
  };

  return <button onClick={()=>handleReleasePost('123')}>Release</button>;
};
```

<H3>Now, what to do with these events?</H3>
<P>This is where the magic happens: You can do whatever you want. Really ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</P>
<P>You will run into a situations, that you have multiple event listeners registered. Some ideas: You can use these events to update
  stored models on a server, you can send all these events to analysis tool, like <ExternalLink
    href="https://posthog.com/">Posthog,</ExternalLink> or just log them to the browser console during development.</P>
<P>Some day customers will ask you for a feature, and they will say: "When X happens, can you also do Y. At this moment you will be ready
  for it.</P>

<H3>Combining events</H3>
<P>Another example: You want to display, that you are loading some data from the backend. When thinking data driven, you put a
  boolean in you application state. The event approach is different: When there was as 'loading' command, and you the resource is not
  returned yet, you are sure that your application is loading. Not considering the order, the code can look like this:</P>

```typescript
import {filter, map} from 'rxjs';

const isLoading$ = GlobalEvent$.pipe(
  filter(event => event.type === 'LOADING_COMMAND' || event.type === 'RESOURCE_LOADED'),
  map(event => event.type === 'LOADING_COMMAND'),
);
```

<H3>How to display data?</H3>
<P>I hope that you still have the mindset in mind to split querying data and emitting commands. Also, we live in modern times, where it is
  easy to push updates from the servers to the client. So in the end it is just a stream of data. A repository might look like this:</P>

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

interface IPostRepository {
  readonly Posts$: Observable<Post[]>;
  readonly Post$: Observable<Post>;

  loadPost(postId: string): void;
  loadPosts(): void;
}
```

<P>Your UI component can now the option to subscribe to the `Posts$` observable for displaying the data.</P>

<H2>When to use it</H2>
<P>You might have guesses it, this approach is to much for a static website. Actually the post, you read right now was written with
  Markdown. But if you are building a website with a high amount of interactivity, you want to push updates from the server to the client,
  or are communicating a lot with stakeholders, you might give it a try.</P>
