        The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution, which you can find at

      <P>
        Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence.
        Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator

        possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of

      <P>
        A permanent control of the linked sites is, however, unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation
        of the law. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
